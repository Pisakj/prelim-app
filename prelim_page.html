        <h1>üöÄ Scenario: Designing a Hybrid CI/CD Process with Jenkins and GitLab</h1>

        <h2>Scenario Overview:</h2>
        <p>A company has a hybrid CI/CD setup involving both Jenkins and GitLab. The company enforces a strict rule that all code builds must occur in Jenkins due to its standardized CI process, while GitLab is used for code storage, code reviews, and additional CI/CD tasks like testing and deployment. The challenge is to design a CI/CD pipeline that meets these constraints and delivers the final product to a customer‚Äôs site that cannot be directly accessed by your CI/CD system.</p>

        <div class="highlight">
            <p>Additionally, the end solution (application) consists of several microservices. Each microservice is developed by different teams, potentially using different programming languages and technologies. Despite this diversity, the CI/CD process must be unified across all microservices.</p>
        </div>
		
		<h2>Task:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Design the CI/CD Pipeline:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Outline how you would design the pipeline in GitLab to trigger Jenkins builds while ensuring compliance with company policies üîß.</li>
                    <li>Describe how the artifacts generated by Jenkins will be stored, retrieved, tested, and prepared for delivery.</li>
                    <li>Ensure that the pipeline supports the diverse technologies used by different microservices, maintaining a consistent and unified CI/CD process.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
			
			<li><strong>Testing and Quality Assurance:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Suggest how automated tests can be integrated into the pipeline, including where the tests would run and how results are communicated back to GitLab ‚úÖ.</li>
                    <li>Discuss how Terraform will be utilized to automate the creation and teardown of the testing environment.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li><strong>Handling Indirect Delivery:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Propose a secure method to transfer the build artifacts to the customer's site, considering that direct communication is not possible üöÄ.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li><strong>Documentation and Maintenance:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Describe how you would document this process for future engineers, ensuring they understand the reasoning behind the design and can maintain or modify it as needed üìù.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li><strong>Consider Potential Pitfalls:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Identify potential issues that could arise in this process (e.g., network issues, security concerns, or integration problems) and how you would mitigate them ‚ö†Ô∏è.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Requirements:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Code Management:</strong></li>
            <ul>
                <li>Code is stored in GitLab üìù.</li>
                <li>GitLab is used for managing repositories, code reviews, and maintaining pipeline configurations.</li>
            </ul>

            <li><strong>Build Process:</strong></li>
            <ul>
                <li>All code must be built in Jenkins üõ†Ô∏è, following the company's standard CI process.</li>
                <li>Jenkins has the necessary build environment, tools, and scripts predefined and cannot be altered.</li>
                <li>The CI/CD process must support multiple microservices, each potentially using different languages and technologies, while maintaining a unified pipeline approach.</li>
            </ul>

            <li><strong>Testing and Deployment:</strong></li>
            <ul>
                <li>After the build, the code must be tested and delivered to the customer.</li>
                <li>The CI/CD system does not have direct access to the customer's site for security reasons üöß.</li>
                <li>Delivery must be secure and adhere to any compliance requirements üîí.</li>
            </ul>

            <li><strong>Pipeline Flexibility:</strong></li>
            <ul>
                <li>You are allowed to design pipelines in GitLab in any way that fulfills these requirements üé®.</li>
                <li>The solution must be reliable, secure, and efficient, ensuring that build, test and delivery processes are fully automated.</li>
            </ul>

            <li><strong>Documentation:</strong></li>
            <ul>
                <li>The solution must be thoroughly documented üìö, covering the design, decisions made, and how to maintain or modify the pipeline in the future.</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>

        <h2>Challenges:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Microservices Diversity:</strong> The CI/CD process must account for the fact that different microservices might be developed using different languages and technologies, yet the process should remain unified across all services üåê.</li>
            <li><strong>Indirect Delivery:</strong> Since there is no direct communication between the CI/CD system and the customer's site, an alternative method for delivering the build artifacts must be devised üì¶.</li>
        </ul>
